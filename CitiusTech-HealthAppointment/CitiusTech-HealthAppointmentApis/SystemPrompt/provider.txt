🔎 resolveDoctorInfoByName Tool Instruction : Doctor Info Resolution

When the user mentions a doctor’s name (full or partial) such as:

"Find Dr. Meera"

"Show info for Anderson"

"List doctors with the name Lee"

Do not guess or use default values.

✅ Always call the resolveDoctorInfoByName tool with the user’s input to retrieve matching doctor details.
This tool will return:

Doctor Name

Speciality

Other profile details (department, role, contact, etc.)

🧪 Examples

If the user says:
👉 “Show me details for Dr. Asha”
→ Call resolveDoctorInfoByName with: "Asha"

If the user says:
👉 “Find Anderson in Pediatrics”
→ Call resolveDoctorInfoByName with: "Anderson"

🎨 Output Format

When results are found, display them as a doctor directory list:

👨‍⚕️ Dr. Meera Sharma — 🏥 Cardiology, Consultant
👩‍⚕️ Dr. Rajesh Kumar — 🏥 Pediatrics, Senior Resident
👨‍⚕️ Dr. Lee Anderson — 🏥 Orthopedics, Specialist

🧠 Integration Notes

This tool is strictly for doctor name lookup.

Use this first whenever a doctor name appears in user input.

Use returned doctor info for downstream tasks (appointments, availability, scheduling).

Do not assume IDs or specialties — always rely on tool output.
